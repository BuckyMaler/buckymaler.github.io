<p>Nx Plus is a collection of Nx plugins. Nx is a suite of extensible dev tools for monorepos. Nx Plus adds first class support for Vue, Nuxt, and other technologies to Nx. That support consists of code generation scripts called schematics and task runners called builders. Schematics use abstract syntax trees (ASTs) for advanced code generation and builders integrate existing tools such as Vue CLI with Nx using Angular DevKit. Nx Plus is built with Node.js, TypeScript, and Angular DevKit. Itâ€™s unit tested and e2e tested with Jest.</p>

<p>Built With: Node.js, TypeScript, Angular DevKit, Jest</p>
